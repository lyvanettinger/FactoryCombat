# FactoryCombat

This project is a small text based game made for myself to get familiar with several things:
* Working with Git as source control; until now I haven't actively been using and am not familiar at all with this. I've used a different source control before (Perforce) but since Git is widely used, I want to also learn to work with it.
* Learn the factory programming pattern
